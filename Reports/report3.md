# Snatch Ransomware

First appearing in 2018, Snatch operates a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and claimed their first U.S.-based victim in 2019. Originally, the group was referred to as Team Truniger, based on the nickname of a key group member, Truniger, who previously operated as a GandCrab affiliate. Snatch threat actors use a customized ransomware variant notable for rebooting devices into Safe Mode, enabling the ransomware to circumvent detection by antivirus or endpoint protection, and then encrypting files when few services are running.

Snatch threat actors have been observed purchasing previously stolen data from other ransomware variants in an attempt to further exploit victims into paying a ransom to avoid having their data released on Snatch’s extortion blog. Note: Since November 2021, an extortion site operating under the name Snatch served as a clearinghouse for data exfiltrated or stolen from victim companies on Clearnet and TOR hosted by a bulletproof hosting service. In August 2023, individuals claiming to be associated with the blog gave a media interview claiming the blog was not associated with Snatch ransomware and “none of our targets has been attacked by Ransomware Snatch…”, despite multiple confirmed Snatch victims’ data appearing on the blog alongside victims associated with other ransomware groups, notably Nokoyawa and Conti.

### Initial Access and Persistence
Snatch threat actors employ several different methods to gain access to and maintain persistence on a victim’s network. Snatch affiliates primarily rely on exploiting weaknesses in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for brute-forcing and gaining administrator credentials to victims’ networks. In some instances, Snatch affiliates have sought out compromised credentials from criminal forums/marketplaces.

Snatch threat actors gain persistence on a victim’s network by compromising an administrator account and establishing connections over port 443 to a command and control (C2) server located on a Russian bulletproof hosting service. Per IP traffic from event logs provided by recent victims, Snatch threat actors initiated RDP connections from a Russian bulletproof hosting service and through other virtual private network (VPN) services.

### Data Discovery and Lateral Movement
Snatch threat actors were observed using different TTPs to discover data, move laterally, and search for data to exfiltrate. Snatch threat actors use sc.exe to configure, query, stop, start, delete, and add system services using the Windows Command line. In addition to sc.exe, Snatch threat actors also use tools such as Metasploit and Cobalt Strike.

Prior to deploying the ransomware, Snatch threat actors were observed spending up to three months on a victim’s system. Within this timeframe, Snatch threat actors exploited the victim’s network, moving laterally across the victim’s network with RDP for the largest possible deployment of ransomware and searching for files and folders for data exfiltration followed by file encryption.

### Defense Evasion and Execution
During the early stages of ransomware deployment, Snatch threat actors attempt to disable antivirus software and run an executable as a file named safe.exe or some variation thereof. In recent victims, the ransomware executable’s name consisted of a string of hexadecimal characters which match the SHA-256 hash of the file in an effort to defeat rule-based detection. Upon initiation, the Snatch ransomware payload queries and modifies registry keys, uses various native Windows tools to enumerate the system, finds processes, and creates benign processes to execute Windows batch (.bat) files. In some instances, the program attempts to remove all the volume shadow copies from a system. After the execution of the batch files, the executable removes the batch files from the victim’s filesystem.

The Snatch ransomware executable appends a series of hexadecimal characters to each file and folder name it encrypts—unique to each infection—and leaves behind a text file titled HOW TO RESTORE YOUR FILES.TXT in each folder. Snatch threat actors communicate with their victims through email and the Tox communication platform based on identifiers left in ransom notes or through their extortion blog. Since November 2021, some victims reported receiving a spoofed call from an unknown female who claimed association with Snatch and directed them to the group’s extortion site. In some instances, Snatch victims had a different ransomware variant deployed on their systems, but received a ransom note from Snatch threat actors. As a result, the victims’ data is posted on the ransomware blog involving the different ransomware variant and on the Snatch threat actors’ extortion blog.
