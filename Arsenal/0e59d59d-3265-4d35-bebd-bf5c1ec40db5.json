The contents of these variables are executed as if they had been typed on the command line. The PROMPT_COMMAND variable if set will be executed before the PS1 variable and can be configured to write the latest bash history entries to the syslog.  To gain persistence the command could be added to the users .bashrc or .bash_aliases or the systems default .bashrc in /etc/skel/  ",
