    "description": "DiskCryptor, an open source encryption utility, can be exploited by adversaries for encrypting all disk partitions, including system partitions. This tool was identified in a ransomware campaign, as reported on https://thedfirreport.com/2021/11/15/exchange-exploit-leads-to-domain-wide-ransomware/. The documentation for DiskCryptor can be found at https://github.com/DavidXanatos/DiskCryptor. During the installation process, running dcrypt.exe starts the encryption console. It's important to note that a system reboot is necessary as part of the installation. ",
