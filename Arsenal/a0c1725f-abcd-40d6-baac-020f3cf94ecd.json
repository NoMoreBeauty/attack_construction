    "description": "Executes shellcode in a remote process.  Steps taken with this technique 1. Get a handle to the target process 2. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAllocEx setting the page permissions to Read/Write 3. Use the WriteProcessMemory to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space in the remote process 4. Change the memory page permissions to Execute/Read with VirtualProtectEx 5. Execute the entrypoint of the shellcode in the remote process with RtlCreateUserThread 6. Close the handle to the remote process  - PoC Credit: (https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/go-shellcode/tree/master#rtlcreateuserthread) - References:    - https://www.cobaltstrike.com/blog/cobalt-strikes-process-injection-the-details-cobalt-strike ",
