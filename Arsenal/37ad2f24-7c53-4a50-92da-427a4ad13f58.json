    "description": "The Bash shell runs ~/.bash_logout if it exists to run commands on user logout. An adversary may create or append to a .bash_logout to clear history, start processes etc. Note the ~/.bash_logout is only run if you explicitly exit or log out of an interactive login shell session i.e. via the console, SSH, /bin/bash -l or su -l <username>.   This test creates the art user, logs in, creates a .bash_logout which will echo some text into the art.txt file on logout and logs out and the /home/art/art.txt is created. ",
