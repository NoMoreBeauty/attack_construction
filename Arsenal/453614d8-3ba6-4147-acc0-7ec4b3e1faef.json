Certain processes are not typically observed compiling C# code, but can do so without touching disk. This can be used to unpack a payload for execution. The exe file that will be executed is named as T1027.004_DynamicCompile.exe is contained in the 'bin' folder of this atomic, and the source code to the file is in the 'src' folder. Upon execution, the exe will print 'T1027.004 Dynamic Compile'. ",
