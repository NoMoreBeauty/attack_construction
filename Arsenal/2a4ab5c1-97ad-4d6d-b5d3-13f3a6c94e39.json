    "description": "Leverages the Windows CreateRemoteThread function from Kernel32.dll to execute shellcode in a remote process.  This program loads the DLLs and gets a handle to the used procedures itself instead of using the windows package directly.  1. Get a handle to the target process 2. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAllocEx setting the page permissions to Read/Write 3. Use the WriteProcessMemory to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space in the remote process 4. Change the memory page permissions to Execute/Read with VirtualProtectEx 5. Execute the entrypoint of the shellcode in the remote process with CreateRemoteThread 6. Close the handle to the remote process  - PoC Credit: (https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/go-shellcode#createremotethreadnative) ",
