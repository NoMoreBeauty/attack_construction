    "description": "Identify System language by checking the environment variables  Upon successful execution, the 5 character locale result can be looked up to correlate the language and territory. Environment query commands are likely to run with a pattern match command e.g. `env | grep LANG`  Note: `env` and `printenv` will usually provide the same results. `set` is also used as a builtin command that does not generate syscall telemetry but does provide a list of the environment variables.
